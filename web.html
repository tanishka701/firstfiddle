				<div class="two">
					<p>Mechanical engineering is one of the oldest and broadest engineering disciplines that apply the principles of engineering, physics and materials science, Mathematics for analysis, design, manufacturing, and maintenance of mechanical systems. It is the branch of engineering that involves the production and usage of heat and mechanical power for the design, production, and operation /Maintenance of machines and tools required for process/chemical industries, refineries and petrochemicals, fertilizers, air separation plants and cryogenics, power plants and infrastructure projects. This engineering field requires an understanding of core concepts including mechanics, kinematics, thermodynamics, materials science, structural analysis, and electricity.</p>
